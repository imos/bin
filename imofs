#!/bin/bash
# A command-line tool to backup/restore files and services.
#
# This command is useful especially for programming contests giving an disk
# image, and imofs backs up the initial state and restores almost everything.
# Directories to backup/restore are specified as TARGETS, and services to
# backup/restore are specified as SERVICES.
#
# Usage:
#     imofs [options] command
#
# Command:
#   - restore
#       Restore files and services.
#   - backup
#       Backup files and services.
#
# Configurations:
#   - /backup/imofs/services
#       Services to backup/restore.  This file is updated when you call
#       backup command.
#   - /backup/imofs/targets
#       Directories to backup/restore.  A directory should not end with "/".
